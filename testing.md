# MILESTONE 1 PROJECT NAME - TESTING

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Found-In-Translation/blob/main/TESTING.md#found-in-translation----testing-documentation)

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional shields.io badges to your TESTING file, I like to add them to this section (Shields.io have some badges for W3C validation which makes it easy to see at a glance whether the project has passed validation).

## AUTOMATED TESTING

###  W3C Validator

W3C was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS. I have checked the HTML via direct input and also by inspecting the page source and running this through the validator.

Index - No errors or warnings.

Trails -No errors or warnings.

Newsletter - No errors or warnings.

Landingpage - No errors or warnings.

Error 404 - No errors or warnings.

CSS - No errors or warnings.

#### **URI Input**

If you validate with your sites URL, you can run the validation and then copy the link from the address bar and insert the link here as your proof of validation.

Index - https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbluiss.github.io%2Fwinchester-bike-club%2F

Trails - https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbluiss.github.io%2Fwinchester-bike-club%2Ftrails.html

Newsletter - https://bluiss.github.io/winchester-bike-club/newsletter.html

Landingpage - https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbluiss.github.io%2Fwinchester-bike-club%2Flandingpage.html%3Ffirst-name%3DHarry%26last-name%3DBritton%26email-address%3Dharrydbritton%2540gmail.com

Error 404 - https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbluiss.github.io%2Fwinchester-bike-club%2F404

#### **CSS Validation**

CSS Validation can only be done by copying and pasting the CSS file contents into the direct input. Make sure that the checkbox for CSS is selected.

### Lighthouse

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed lighthouse testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022/blob/main/TESTING.md#Lighthouse)

Lighthouse Testing is part of the Chrome Developer Tools. For more information on how to use this tool, please visit [chrome Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en#:~:text=Lighthouse%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource,how%20well%20the%20page%20did.).

You will need to run the Lighthouse testing on each individual page of your site, for desktop as a minimum. If you have time it would be great to also add in the mobile testing.

### WAVE

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed WAVE testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022/blob/main/TESTING.md#WAVE)

[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) is an accessibility testing tool. I like to run this on each page of my site and take a screenshot of the results to add here. They have a website for testing and a Chrome extension.

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

List (or put in a table) all known bugs on your site here as soon as you find them. This will prevent you from forgetting any at the end. Some (if not all) of these bugs will hopefully make their way over to the next section, solved bugs, as you progress through your project.

### Solved Bugs

üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªView an example of a completed bugs section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm/blob/main/TESTING.md#BUGS)

This is where all solved bugs go once squashed. List what the bug was, and how you managed to fix it. You can also include images/videos here if you wanted.
