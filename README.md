## Features

### General features on each page

The website is comprised of three pages which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, trails & newsletter). 
‚Ä¢	All Pages on the website have:

‚Ä¢	A responsive navigation bar at the top of all pages, allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is an image of WMTB club‚Äôs logo. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the site‚Äôs pages (home page, trails & newsletter). 
To allow a good user experience of the site, when viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

A footer which contains social media icon links to Instagram, Twitter, YouTube & Facebook. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

### Future Implementations

‚Ä¢	Future Implementations.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
