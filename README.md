## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

The website is comprised of three pages which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, trails & newsletter). 
‚Ä¢	All Pages on the website have:
o	A responsive navigation bar at the top of all pages, allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is an image of WMTB club‚Äôs logo. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the site‚Äôs pages (home page, trails & newsletter). 
To allow a good user experience of the site, when viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.
Reference - https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/MWEJEWG 
o	A footer which contains social media icon links to Instagram, Twitter, YouTube & Facebook. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.
‚Ä¢	Home Page.
-	Hero image that states the club‚Äôs moto and main header 
- 	Reference - https://codetheweb.blog/fullscreen-image-hero/ - hero image
-	About Us Section. ‚Äì Gives and overview of the clubs‚Äô goals and how it can help both new and old riders. Also explains the purpose of the club
-	3 images with explanations, going over the different disciplines (Enduro, Downhill, Dirt Jump) with an overlay header

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
